# Conduit Connector File

The File plugin is one of [Conduit](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit) builtin plugins.
It provides both source and destination File connectors, allowing for a file to be either
a source, or a destination in a Conduit pipeline.

<!-- readmegen:description -->
## How it works

The Source connector listens for changes appended to the source file and
sends records with the changes.
The Destination connector receives records and writes them to a file.

### Source

The Source connector only cares to have a valid path, even if the file
doesn't exist, it will still run and wait until a file with the configured
name is there, then it will start listening to changes and sending records.

### Destination

The Destination connector will create the file if it doesn't exist, and
records with changes will be appended to the destination file when received.<!-- /readmegen:description -->

## How to build it

Run `make`.

## Testing

Run `make test` to run all the tests.

## Limitations

* The  Source connector only detects appended changes to the file, so it
  doesn't detect deletes or edits.
* The connectors can only access local files on the machine where Conduit
  is running. So, running Conduit on a server means it can't access a file
  on your local machine.
* Currently, only works reliably with text files (may work with non-text
  files, but not guaranteed)
